Run these commands one by one in your terminal:

1. cd /Users/ryansavoia/user-dashboard

2. git merge --abort
   (This will abort the stuck merge)

3. git status
   (Check what files are modified)

4. git add app/builder/page.tsx app/api/query-engine/upcoming-props/route.ts

5. git pull --no-rebase
   (This will pull remote changes and merge automatically)

6. git push origin main
   (This will push your changes)

If step 5 gives merge conflicts, you'll need to resolve them first, then:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Merge remote changes"
   git push origin main
